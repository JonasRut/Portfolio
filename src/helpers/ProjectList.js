        describtion: "I made this game in Unity for the my final project of the Harvard CS50x course. I had experience with Unity in the past but wanted to learn how to make a bot and impliment it in a game. In this game, MistyMaze, the player tries to navigate through the maze to find a golden cube in order to win. However, there are enemies along the way and if you touch them you will lose."

        skills: "Fusion360, 3D Printing",
        describtion: "For school I am part of a group called the Technology Student Association (TSA). In TSA my group was tasked to complete the challenge of building an RC Car and racing it at the regional and state competitions. There was also a determining factor of carrying marbles in the race that could dock points from our lap score if dropped. To carry the marbles in the specified cup I created a gyroscope that would stay level to the ground as the car took sharp turn with the hope of preventing spillage. I also added a barrier for additional insurance."

        skills: "Fusion360, 3D Printing",
        describtion: "Whenever I go on runs outside of my town I find it annoying to carry my car keys in my hands or pocket. This triggered the idea of a flexible keyholder to hold my car keys as well as other types and models for those who may have the same problem when they are running."

        describtion: "Harvard and several other schools provide many of there courses online for completely free. I wanted to take advantage of this and learn more about computer science and programming from this course which has been useful in current problem solving."
