I had experience with Unity in the past but wanted to learn how to make a bot and implement it in a game. In this game, MistyMaze, the player tries to navigate through the maze to find a golden cube to win. However, there are enemies along the way and if you touch them you will lose.",

        describtion: "In high school, I was part of the Technology Student Association (TSA). In TSA my group was tasked to complete the challenge of building an RC Car and racing it at the regional and state competitions. There was also a determining factor of carrying marbles in the race that could dock points from our lap score if dropped. To carry the marbles in the specified cup I created a gyroscope that would stay level to the ground as the car took sharp turns with the hope of preventing spillage. I also added a barrier for additional insurance.",
